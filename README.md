In this project I played around with financial data for a company selling cars.


Insights:
1.) The Government is where we generated over 80% of out profit
2.) September through December is where most of our sales happen.
3.) Paseo is our most popular product.
4.) France is our most profitable country.

Questions going forward:
1.) How do we market to Channel partners, Mid Market, and Enterprise better?
2.) Do we need to cut out Enterprise completly
3.) Can we cut the price of COGS for VTT?
